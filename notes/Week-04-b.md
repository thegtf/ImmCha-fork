## Break

## Second Half

### Team Development Time (30 minutes)
In breakout rooms, continue working on your strategy.

### Upload
Zip up your files and upload them to Battlecode.

### Screenshare (10 minutes)
Each team will screenshare for the class their player playing against
`lectureplayer` and `teacher04a`, describing any questions that came up during their development process.

Remember! You are not competing against each other, but against the reference player.

We're not able to run scrimmages against reference player directly right now (they keep freezing it during the tournaments), but we'll keep trying next week and after.

The closest player you should test your strategy against is `lectureplayer` and `teacher04a`.
