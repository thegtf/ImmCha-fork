   I hope to gain a better understanding of Java and how it relates to video game development.



   Cyberpunk 2077 is a fantastic game and has a very well developed storyline. I have played through it a few times. Recently, they added a DLC called Phantom Liberty. I played through the game again to experience this DLC. Without giving a lot away, I was heading into this new area called Dogtown. My goal was to find these hidden Tarot cards that are located in this portion of the map. As I begin to walk into this section and spot the card (its a big painted mural on a wall), I am struck with all of this data corruption in my head. It's really amazing cutscene of being introduced to this character called Songbird. Things get really weird and she sends you on this journey that ultimately has you save the President. The way these few story elements progress are just really intriguging. The value of human life is sort of the main story thread of this game. The main character (YOU), V, goes through a chaotic event that leaves a second consciousness inside their brain and part of the game is to deal with this consciousness, Johnny Silverhand, voiced by Keanu Reeves. The soundtrack is epic and these moments lead up to the DLC soundtrack kicking off with the title card of the DLC, -Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. These AAA budget games are like playing through blockbuster films and I really enjoy that.
